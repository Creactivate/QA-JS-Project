Why are we doing this? 
To show what we have learned during the 5 week academy. For this project it was JS, CSS and HTML knowledge.
Handling forms and tables are key components in web applications, being able to view, add, edit and delete entries are the most important functions.

How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected the challenge to go well as I felt I understood all the concepts involved

What went well? 
I think the logic of the functionality was executed well.

What didn't go as planned?
My laptop died with my files on, luckly I had the code saved to github.

Possible improvements for future 
The overall design could be improved visually using CSS. The website could also be responsive to work better on different screen sizes.
The frontend could then be connected to a backend and database.
